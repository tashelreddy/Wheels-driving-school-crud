# Wheels-driving-school-crud

This website was built using bootstrap framework, php and sql (phpmyadmin). My first time using Xammp server. 
It is a driving school website containing a database for admin access. 
With help from various tutorials the login and admin page were created (still working on changing the look and feel of the admin page).
This site currently lives on my desktop locally.
This website was meant to be an introduction to my learning php and sql. 

It was very fun learning some backend.

Next to be added will be password forgotten, how to get that email sent to you so that password can be changed.
